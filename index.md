# Marin

Marin is an open community for building foundation models---together.
We're training powerful models from scratch, and sharing and programmatically documenting every step:
the code, the data, the experiments, the mistakes...all in real-time.
We invite anyone who shares our vision of open science and open-source to join and contribute,
whether you want to try out a new architecture, training algorithm, dataset,
evaluation...there is a lot to do!

You can find us at:

Want to jump in?  [Install](https://marin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/getting-started/) the Marin code and
[run your first experiment](https://marin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/first-experiment/)!

## Speedrun üèÉ

Have a new architecture or training procedure that's more efficient?
Participate in our speedrun competition (inspired by the [nanogpt speedrun](https://github.com/KellerJordan/modded-nanogpt?tab=readme-ov-file#world-record-history))
and create the fastest method to train a model to a certain loss!
Get started [here](https://marin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how-to-guides/submitting-speedrun/).

## Datashop üõ†Ô∏è

Want to add new capabilities to the Marin models?
Go visit our datashop, where you can upload a dataset or craft a prompt to curate a relevant dataset for your task.

## Models üåê

We have trained a strong 8B parameter model.  Try it out [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/WillHeld/soft-racoon-test)!

## Acknowledgements

Marin wouldn't be possible without the generous support of the [Google TPU Research Cloud program](https://sites.research.google/trc/about/).
We also benefit immensely from the broader open ecosystem, who have released numerous tools and datasets, including
[AI2](https://allenai.org), [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/), [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/research/), etc.
